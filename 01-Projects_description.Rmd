The data used along this section is a synthetic data set generated by the CINECA project made freely available under the Creative Commons Licence (CC-BY) (funding: EC H2020 grant 825775). It has been pruned and the individuals have been separated into three synthetic cohorts. For the "Single cohort" use case, all the individuals are used. Information on individuals and SNP count of each cohort can be found on the Table \@ref(tab:tab1).
