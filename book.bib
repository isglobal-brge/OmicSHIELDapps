abstract = {Background
Growing evidence exists about the fetal and environmental origins of hypertension, but mainly limited to single-exposure studies. The exposome has been proposed as a more holistic approach by studying many exposures simultaneously.
Objectives
This study aims to evaluate the association between a wide range of prenatal and postnatal exposures and blood pressure (BP) in children.
Methods
Systolic and diastolic BP were measured among 1,277 children from the European HELIX (Human Early-Life Exposome) cohort aged 6 to 11 years. Prenatal (n = 89) and postnatal (n = 128) exposures include air pollution, built environment, meteorology, natural spaces, traffic, noise, chemicals, and lifestyles. Two methods adjusted for confounders were applied: an exposome-wide association study considering the exposures independently, and the deletion-substitution-addition algorithm considering all the exposures simultaneously.
Results
Decreases in systolic BP were observed with facility density (β change for an interquartile-range increase in exposure: −1.7 mm Hg [95% confidence interval (CI): −2.5 to −0.8 mm Hg]), maternal concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl 118 (−1.4 mm Hg [95% CI: −2.6 to −0.2 mm Hg]) and child concentrations of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE: −1.6 mm Hg [95% CI: −2.4 to −0.7 mm Hg]), hexachlorobenzene (−1.5 mm Hg [95% CI: −2.4 to −0.6 mm Hg]), and mono−benzyl phthalate (−0.7 mm Hg [95% CI: −1.3 to −0.1 mm Hg]), whereas increases in systolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature during pregnancy (1.6 mm Hg [95% CI: 0.2 to 2.9 mm Hg]), high fish intake during pregnancy (2.0 mm Hg [95% CI: 0.4 to 3.5 mm Hg]), maternal cotinine concentrations (1.2 mm Hg [95% CI: -0.3 to 2.8 mm Hg]), and child perfluorooctanoate concentrations (0.9 mm Hg [95% CI: 0.1 to 1.6 mm Hg]). Decreases in diastolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature at examination (−1.4 mm Hg [95% CI: −2.3 to −0.5 mm Hg]) and child DDE concentrations (−1.1 mm Hg [95% CI: −1.9 to −0.3 mm Hg]), whereas increases in diastolic BP were observed with maternal bisphenol-A concentrations (0.7 mm Hg [95% CI: 0.1 to 1.4 mm Hg]), high fish intake during pregnancy (1.2 mm Hg [95% CI: −0.2 to 2.7 mm Hg]), and child copper concentrations (0.9 mm Hg [95% CI: 0.3 to 1.6 mm Hg]).
Conclusions
This study suggests that early-life exposure to several chemicals, as well as built environment and meteorological factors, may affect BP in children.}

	abstract = {Multitask learning allows the simultaneous learning of multiple {\textquoteleft}communicating{\textquoteright} algorithms. It is increasingly adopted for biomedical applications, such as the modeling of disease progression. As data protection regulations limit data sharing for such analyses, an implementation of multitask learning on geographically distributed data sources would be highly desirable. Here, we describe the development of dsMTL, a computational framework for privacy-preserving, distributed multi-task machine learning that includes three supervised and one unsupervised algorithms. dsMTL is implemented as a library for the R programming language and builds on the DataSHIELD platform that supports the federated analysis of sensitive individual-level data. We provide a comparative evaluation of dsMTL for the identification of biological signatures in distributed datasets using two case studies, and evaluate the computational performance of the supervised and unsupervised algorithms. dsMTL provides an easy- to-use framework for privacy-preserving, federated analysis of geographically distributed datasets, and has several application areas, including comorbidity modeling and translational research focused on the simultaneous prediction of different outcomes across datasets. dsMTL is available at https://github.com/transbioZI/dsMTLBase (server-side package) and https://github.com/transbioZI/dsMTLClient (client-side package).Competing Interest StatementAML has received consultant fees from: Boehringer Ingelheim, Elsevier, Brainsway, Lundbeck Int.
