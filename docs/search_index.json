[["DatasetDescription.html", "1 Dataset description. 1.1 HELIX project.", " 1 Dataset description. In this section, we will describe the data employed for each showcase, giving details about experimental design, the type of features available in each data layer, and the structure and organization of data in the Opal infrastructure. Particularly, all datasets employed in this book are uploaded to the Opal BRGE site hosted by the Bioinformatic Research Group in Epidemiology of ISGlobal, simulating a single-site DataSHIELD infrastructure. Details for accessing the server will be found in each section, at the beginning of each pipeline. 1.1 HELIX project. The real-world research problem presented in this book comes from the HELIX Project. The HELIX (Human Early-Life Exposome) project gathers data from 6 longitudinal-based European birth cohorts, with the aim of evaluating the effect of environmental risk factors on mothers and children health, with a special focus in the effects on molecular health profiles (omic data). HELIX cohorts include the BIB (Born in Bradford) (United Kingdom), EDEN (Étude des Déterminants pré et postnatals du développement et de la santé de l’ENfant) (France), INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente) (Spain), KANC (Kaunus Cohort) (Lithuania), MoBa (Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study) (Norway), and Rhea (Mother-Child Cohort in Crete) (Greece). General details of the study design of HELIX can be found in the Figure 1.1. The whole HELIX dataset includes a total of 31,472 mother-child pairs. Among them, a subcohort of 1,301 children (approximately 200 children in each cohort) was selected here according to the following criteria of eligibility: 1) age 6 to 11 years; 2) omic data available (including gene expression and EWAS data); 3) complete address history; and 4) no serious health problems that may affect the clinical testing or the child safety. Figure 1.1: General overview of the HELIX research project. In the 1,301 children, a wide range of environmental exposures were evaluated to define the early-life exposome during two time periods: the prenatal pregnancy period and childhood (age 6 to 11 years). Collected exposures can be organized into three main parts of the exposome: outdoor exposures, chemical exposures measured through biomarkers, and lifestyle factors. All variables incorporated in the dataset have been appropriately pre-processed previous to analysis (outliers removal, normalization, and missing values imputation). Regarding phenotype data, a wide range of health outcomes are also available for the childhood period including phenotypes related to (1) obesity and cardiometabolic health, (2) respiratory health, and (3) cognition and mental health. Finally, omic data (mainly transcriptomic and genome-wide DNA methylation data) are also available in the childhood period. The objective of this dataset will be illustrating how to perform, using DataSHIELD: Exposome Data Analysis. Deliverable of ATHLETE project. Differential gene expression analysis. Differential DNA methylation analysis. 1.1.1 Data organization in the Opal server. Exposome and omic data from the HELIX project were uploaded into to the Opal BRGE site simulating a single-site DataSHIELD architecture, as illustrated in Figure 1.2. Data were stored under the form of resources (one per cohort and data type). On the one hand, the exposome data were stored as exposomeSet objects, a particular R format deriving from the rexposome package (Hernandez-Ferrer, Gonzalez, and Escribà-Montagut 2021). The exposomeSet type is an R object made up of three different tables (exposures, phenotype data and description). Having an exposomeSet loaded in the DataSHIELD environment as a resource will extremely facilitate the exposome data analysis. On the other hand, omic data (mainly EWAS and transcriptomic data) were stored under the form of expressionSets. A summary of the structure and organization of this data in the Opal for the HELIX project is illustrated in Figure 1.2. Figure 1.2: Input HELIX datasets organized by cohort in the Opal server. The data analyst corresponds to the “RStudio” session, which through DataSHIELD Interface (DSI) connects with the Opal server. In the next subsection, we present extra details for each of these datasets. 1.1.1.1 Exposome data. Exposome data for each of the HELIX cohorts was available in the form of resources (including phenotype and exposure data). A screenshot of these files stored in the Opal server can be viewed in the Figure 1.3. As it can be seen, data are stored in the Opal server within a project called HELIX. Figure 1.3: Input ExposomeSet data organized by cohort in the Opal server as resources. Additional phenotype data for the HELIX cohorts was available in the form of separate tables Figure 1.4. Figure 1.4: Additional HELIX phenotype data organized by cohort in the Opal server as tables. In total, exposome data include information for 1,301 subjects, 115 exposures and 88 phenotypes Table 1.1. Table 1.1: General description for the HELIX exposome dataset. Cohort N Individuals N Predictors N Phenotypes BIB_cohort 202 115 88 EDEN_cohort 198 115 88 INMA-SAB_cohort 224 115 88 KANC_cohort 207 115 88 MoBA_cohort 272 115 88 Rhea_cohort 198 115 88 Combined Studies 1301 115 88 1.1.1.2 Gene expression data. The gene expression data available for the HELIX cohorts correspond to microarray data deriving from the Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 platform of Affymetrix. These are hosted in the the Opal BRGE site as ExpressionSet objects. ExpressionSets files is a file-format of the BioConductor project that may contain different sources of genomic data. Alongside the genomic data, these data may also contain some phenotypes and metadata associated to the population. Researchers who are not familiar with ExpressionSet can find further information here. Particularly, one ExpressionSet file per cohort is hosted in the Opal BRGE site in the form of a resource, as presented in the Figure @ref(fig:FigHELIXresourcesOpal_transcrip). As it can be seen, data are organized within the Opal server in a project called HELIX_omics. (#fig:FigHELIXresourcesOpal_transcrip)Input ExposomeSet data organized by cohort in the Opal server as resources. 1.1.1.3 Epigenetic data. The epigenetic data available for the HELIX cohorts correspond to genome-wide DNA methylation data obtained by microarray experiments using the Infinium HumanMethylation450k platform from Illumina. The data format in which these data are hosted in the Opal is the type GenomicRatioSet. GenomicRatioSet is a extend of the class SummarizedExperiment especially designed for DNA methylation data obtained with the Infinium HumanMethylation450k platform, that will be analysed with the associated R package minfi. This type of data usually contain pre-processed DNA methylation values at a genome-wide level, in the form of M or/and Beta values, together with the associated genomic coordinates. As in the case of ExpressionSet types, GenomicRatioSet can also incorporate phenotype and metadata information. Particularly, one GenomicRatioSet file per cohort is hosted in the Opal BRGE site in the form of a resource, as presented in the Figure @ref(fig:FigHELIXresourcesOpal_DNAm). As it can be seen, data are organized within the Opal server in a project called HELIX_omics.
