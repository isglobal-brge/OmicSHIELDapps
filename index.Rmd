This is a website for a book that serves as official documentation for applications of OmicSHIELD. On it you will find: 


- GWAS of CINECA data split in 3 different cohorts stored in an Opal repository. Deliverable belonging to [VEIS project](https://veis.bsc.es/en/) that aims to value EGA for Industry and Society.


- Omic data analyses using HELIX project (6 cohorts). It includes:
 
     - Differential expression analysis 

     - Epigenome data analysis 

      - Exposome Data Analysis. Deliverable of [ATHLETE project](https://athleteproject.eu/).

All the applications described on this book have been developed at the Bioinformatic Research Group in Epidemiology ([BRGE](https://brge.isglobal.org/)) from ISGlobal with external collaborators and are part of OmicSHIELD.

The aim of this book is to be a showcase of the capabilities of the software we developed in real problems where the main aim of describing how to perform omic data analyses in multi-cohort studies using a privacy-protected federated system.

This material also serves as an online companion for the manuscript "To be supplied".
