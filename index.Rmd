This online book serves as official documentation for the R package [*OmicSHIELDapps*](https://github.com/isglobal-brge/OmicSHIELDapps). On it you will find examples of applications of *OmicSHIELDapps* to a range of human **omic and environmental data**, illustrating the possibilities and goodness of many of the available functions. For that, we will use data from a real-world  research project following a **multi-centric structure**. This book can be seen therefore as a **showcase** to describe how to perform omic data analyses in a **multi-cohort environment** using a **privacy-protected federated system**. This material will also serve as an **online companion** for the **manuscript** "To be supplied". 

The **data** to be analyzed here come from the: 

* [HELIX Project](https://www.projecthelix.eu): The HELIX (Human Early-Life Exposome) project gathers data from 6 longitudinal-based European birth cohorts, with the aim of evaluating how the environmental hazards that mothers and children are exposed to, affect to health, growth and development of children, also focusing in the mediating effects of molecular alterations. In this project, we will count on **multi-omic and environmental data consisting of (exposome, transcriptomic and epigenetic data)** and present examples of how to perform:
 
  + Exposome Data Analysis. Deliverable of [ATHLETE project](https://athleteproject.eu/).

  + Transcriptomic data analysis. 

  + Epigenetic data analysis. 
  
All the applications described on this book have been developed at the Bioinformatic Research Group in Epidemiology ([BRGE](https://brge.isglobal.org/)) from ISGlobal with external collaborators and are part of **OmicSHIELD**.
